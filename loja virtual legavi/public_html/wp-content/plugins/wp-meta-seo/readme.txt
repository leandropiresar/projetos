WP Meta SEO gives you the control over all your meta content and images. Bulk SEO content and image optimization, SEO on page, 404 & redirect

== Description ==

= WP meta SEO got 7 major functionalities: =

* Bulk edit all website meta on a single view

* Fix HTML image resizing
* Bulk edit image file name and meta
* Bulk edit SEO link title

= Bulk meta edition and image resizing =

Editing meta information on an existing website can be veeeery long, open each post, edit, close it, open again and almost nobody was doing it. Especially if you need to edit content + image meta.
WP Meta SEO is going to list all posts, pages, custom post types and all images. Type your meta content and fix image size and everything is AJAX saved.
Plus, a bulk copy feature is available to save tons of time in your SEO optimization process:
* Content title to All meta titles (optional meta keywords)
* Image name to Image title
* Image name to Image alt
* Optional keyword edition

A bunch of people reduce the size of the pictures in content using handles that results to a HTML resizing. And that's something wrong for SEO, for page loading time and for image quality. 
WP Meta SEO also include this feature in the bulk edition view, you are notified and you can now optimize the size of your images in articles, click fix and it's replaced in your content (no broken links).
